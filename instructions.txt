Dear me,

In case you forget how to do this I'll remind you:

1. Edit the licenseInfo.txt and the installInfo.txt with the new mods and credits.

2. Open pm_modSync.exe in this folder with winRAR.

2. Add the new mods, edit the pm_modSync.version with the new version, and load the text files for both the license and comments.

3. When you finish don't forget to reapply the image and icon.

4. Finally the pm_modSync_version.txt is the master version. All clients update depending on the version of that file. Make its contents match the contents pm_modSync.version file.

5. After all that the clients should recognize the new version and download and install the new pm_modSync.exe file.

Note: Oh and don't alter any paths specifically thee ones (unless you plan on modifying the program):
